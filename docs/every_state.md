# View States

Having defined the states it should now also be possible.
To auto test every state combination possible.

While we have limited ways of changing view states.
Required it to be defined we can actually calculate all possible
view states.

This means the test can cover many edge cases, not thought of.

e.g. 10000 different state combinations could be tested.
Where normally a user only tests maybe 20 of them manually.

And maybe 100 are tested by non automatic tests.

We could also record each an every generated view and test
for them visually. To determine whether it gives the desired
visualization.

This is then where constraints can prevent such state.
(e.g. Stuff overlapping)
